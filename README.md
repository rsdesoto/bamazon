# bamazon

An inventory management system, running on mysql.

## Instructions:

##### Installing the Program

Please note: this game requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) in order to be played. Make sure they are both installed on your computer!

Download the program, mySQL information, and all other files. Navigate to the file location using the terminal, or open the files with a code editor with a built-in terminal. Install all necessary packages using the command "npm i".

In order to add items, enter the item ID and the number of items you want to buy. This will update the mySQL server.

The first option available is printing a list of all items in the store's inventory, including items not in stock.

The second item available is printing a list of all items with 4 or fewer units in stock.

Managers can add more items to the inventory. When choosing this option, managers will be prompted to choose an item from a list. Once it has been chosen, they will be prompted to add the number of items being added to the inventory.

Finally, managers can add new items to store entirely. When choosing this option, managers will be walked through creating a new item.

Once the item has been created, it will show up in the shop's inventory and will be available for customers.
